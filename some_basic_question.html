            <h2><b>What is COVID-19?</b></h2><br>
            <li> COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. WHO first learned of this new
                virus
                on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of <i>viral pneumonia</i> in Wuhan, China.

            <h2><b>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</b></h2><br>          
            <li><b>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are-</b>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Fever</li>
                    <li>Dry cough</li>
                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                </ul>
                <b>Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss of taste or smell</li>
                    <li>Nasal congestion</li>
                    <li>Conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes)</li>
                    <li>Conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes)</li>
                    <li>Headache</li>
                    <li>Muscle or joint pain</li>
                    <li>Different types of skin rash</li>
                    <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
                    <li>Diarrhea</li>
                    <li>Chills or dizziness</li>
                </ul>
                People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing or shortness
                of
                breath, chest pain or pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical care immediately. If
                possible, call your health care provider, hotline or health facility first, so you can be directed to
                the
                right clinic.
            </li>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <h2><b>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</b></h2><br>
            <li>Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital
                treatment. About 15% become seriously ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need
                intensive
                care.
                <br>
                Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome
                (ARDS),
                sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart,
                liver or
                kidneys.
                <br>
                In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a few weeks after infection.
            </li>

            <hr>
            <h2><b>Who is most at risk of severe illness from COVID-19?</b></h2><br>
            <li>People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
                heart
                and
                lung problems, diabetes, obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.
                <br>
                However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.
            </li>

            <hr>
            <h2><b>Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?</b></h2><br>
            <li>Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to
                experience
                symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.
                <br>
                WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, researchers and
                patient
                groups around the world to design and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of
                illness
                to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they
                occur. These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care.

            <h2><b>What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?</b></h2><br>
            <li>In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm infection. Polymerase
                chain
                reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used molecular test. Samples are collected from the nose and/or
                throat
                with a swab. Molecular tests detect virus in the sample by amplifying viral genetic material to
                detectable
                levels. For this reason, a molecular test is used to confirm an active infection, usually within a few
                days
                of
                exposure and around the time that symptoms may begin.

            <hr>
            <h2><b>What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?</b></h2><br>
            <li>Both isolation and quarantine are methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19.
                <br>
                <b>Quarantine</b> is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
                which
                causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain
                separated
                from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a
                designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days.
                <br>
                <b>Isolation</b> is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus.
                Being
                in
                isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive
                clinical care. If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high risk group
                of
                developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you have symptoms, you should remain in
                isolation for at least 10 days plus an additional 3 days without symptoms. If you are infected and do
                not
                develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 10 days from the time you test positive.
            </li>

            <h2><b>What should I do if I have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19?</b></h2><br>
            <li>If you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you may become infected, even if you feel well.

                After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline to find out where and when to get a test.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cooperate with contact-tracing procedures to stop the spread of the virus.</li>
                    <li>If testing is not available, stay home and away from others for 14 days.</li>
                    <li>While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to
                        bring
                        you
                        supplies.</li>
                    <li>Keep at least a 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members</li>
                    <li>Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care.</li>
                    <li>Clean your hands frequently.</li>
                    <li>Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keep the room well-ventilated.</li>
                    <li>If you share a room, place beds at least 1 metre apart.</li>
                    <li>Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days.</li>
                    <li>Stay positive by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising at home.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical help if you have a fever. While
                travelling
                to and from the health facility and during medical care, wear a mask, keep at least a 1-metre distance
                from
                other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands. This applies to adults and children. Read our
                malaria and COVID-19 Q&A for more information.

            <hr>
            <h2><b>What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms?</b></h2><br>
            <li>If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for
                instructions and find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and
                monitor
                your health.

                If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health
                facility
                immediately. Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health
                facility.

                If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical care if you have a fever.

                If local guidance recommends visiting a medical centre for testing, assessment or isolation, wear a
                medical
                mask while travelling to and from the facility and during medical care. Also keep at least a 1-metre
                distance
                from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your hands. This applies to adults and children.
