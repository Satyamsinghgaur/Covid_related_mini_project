        <h2>Make your environment safer</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces where infected
                people
                spend long periods of time together in close proximity.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Outbreaks have been reported in places where people have gather, often in crowded indoor settings and
                where
                they
                talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily or sing such as restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes,
                nightclubs,
                offices and places of worship</li>
            <br>
            <li>To make your environment as safe as possible:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.</li>
                <li>Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces
                    are
                    small and without outdoor air coming in.</li>
                <li>If you can not avoid crowded or indoor settings, take these precautions:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open a window to increase the amount of natural ventilation when indoors.</li>
                    <li>Wear a mask (see above for more details).</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

        <h2>Keep good hygiene</h2>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses that cause colds,
                flu and COVID-19. </li>
            <br>
            <li>To ensure good hygiene you should:</li>

                <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with either an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.
                    This eliminates germs that may be on your hands, including viruses.</li>
                <li>Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Dispose of the
                    used tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands.</li>
                <li>Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently, especially those which are regularly touched, such as door
                    handles, faucets and phone screens.</li>
            </ul>

        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>If you feel unwell, here is what to do:-</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Call by
