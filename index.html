          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <li>Corona Virus which is commonly known as COVID-19 is an infectious disease that causes illness in the
            respiratory system in humans. The term Covid 19 is sort of an acronym, derived from “Novel Corona Virus
            Disease 2019”. Corona Virus has affected our day to day life. This pandemic has affected millions of
            peoples, who are either sick or are being killed due to the spread of this disease.</li>
          <li>COVID-19 is a new virus that is impacting the whole world badly as it is spreading primarily through
            contact with the person. It is spread from person to person among those in close contact within 6 feet. Most
            of the countries have slowed down their manufacturing of the products.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
          <h2>Symptoms of COVID-19</h2>
          <li>The most common symptoms of this viral infection are fever, cold, cough, bone pain, and respiratory
            problems. Apart from these symptoms like Fatigue, Sore throat, muscle pain, loss of smell or taste can also
            be seen in Corona Virus patients.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
          <h2>Prevention of COVID-19</h2>
          <li>Thus, the emphasis is on taking extensive precautions such as extensive hygiene, regularly washing of
            hands with sanitizers or soap, avoidance of face-to-face interaction, social distancing, and wearing a mask,
            etc.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
          <h2>Origin of Coronavirus </h2>
          <li>Coronavirus (or COVID-19) was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city of China. In March 2020, the
            World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the Corona Virus outbreak a pandemic.</li>
          <li>Due to Corona Virus, the Government of India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced nationwide
            lockdown for 21 days on 23 March 2020, limiting the movement of the entire 1.3 billion population of India
            as a preventing measure against the Coronavirus pandemic in India.</li>
          <li>As a result, in India, all educational institutions and almost every commercial establishment had to be
            shut down. International, as well as intra-state travel, was banned. India suspended all tourist visas, as a
            majority of the confirmed cases were linked to other countries.</li>
          <li>Thousands of migrant workers were walking across India to reunite with their families in their native
            places. Indian migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced multiple hardships. With the closure
            of factories and workplaces due to lockdown, millions of migrant workers had to deal with the loss of
            income, food shortages, and uncertainty.</li>
          <li>The various industries and sectors are affected by the cause of this disease including the pharmaceuticals
            industry, power sector, educational institution, tourism. This Coronavirus creates drastic effects on the
            daily life of citizens, as well as on the global economy.</li>
          </p>
          <p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <li>All the governments, health organizations, and other authorities are continuously focusing on identifying
            the cases affected by the COVID-19. Healthcare professionals face lots of difficulties in maintaining the
            quality of healthcare these days.</li>
          <li>With the world facing the coronavirus crisis, the pandemic has wreaked havoc and altered human lives
            forever. Its impact and the untoward consequences will be felt long after the virus diminishes.</li>
          <li>Yet, in times like this, hope is a powerful healer. Mankind stands united in its struggle against the
            Covid 19 pandemic and life will surely triumph.</li>
